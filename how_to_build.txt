STEPS TO BUILD A INSTALLER (Tested on windows and Linux)

1. Install python 3.6 or the currently supported version for fbs: https://build-system.fman.io/troubleshooting  (3.6 is the current)
2. git clone https://github.com/matheusfillipe/ganec.git && pip install virtualenv   -- Python's default virtual env seems to have problems
3. cd ganec && virtualenv venv && source venv/scripts/activate (or just run the activate.bat on windows) -- Create the python vevn and activate.bat
4. pip install -r requirents.txt  -- install libs (if one fails install manually, the only special one is pyproj version 1.9.6 has to be kept outadated... or not?)
5. Create a file named constants.py inside src/main/python/lib/hidden and add your google maps api to a variable API_KEY (API_KEY=KSDJHIAFUE???)
6. Test run with "fbs run" on the active venv. 
7. fbs freeze && fbs installer  (or the installer.bat inside scripts folder if on windows) -- the installer will be created in the target folder
8. You might use fbs freeze --debug to get useful info


IMPORTANT NOTES:

Do not add a __init__.py on the src/main/python folder

Google maps API is paid having a monthly credit which is well enough for what this program does currently. 
The route finding API isn't used, only the map view and geolocating. Path finding is done with OSM and networkx here, so that it be free to use. 
!!! If on windows don't forget to add Python to your system path and to install NSI and add it to path to build an installer !!!!

If you get "failed to import" or "Module not found" on the fbs freeze --debug command or running it, you might add it to src/build/settings/base.json hidden imports.
